# Numerical Integration Methods

The following code uses Numerical methods to evaluate integral and compare the error in these methods. To use the code you will require following libraries:

`matplotlib'
`numpy`

## Running the Code
For now the code is set to evaluate the integral of `sin(x)` on interval [0, pi]. Future code changes will allow to change this the function.
 Use the following command in the console to run the code:
 `python Evaluate.py'
 
 For help use:
 `python Evaluate.py -h'
